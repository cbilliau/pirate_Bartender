# Pirate Bartender
**Description** - A Thinkful.com student project focusing on OO programing and making use of an MVC pattern to create a bartender application that will generate a drink based on the user's Y/N response to four questions.
This project's visuals are based on early text based video games of the mid 1980s (e.g. *The Bard's Tale* by Electronic Arts). Pirate image is taken from Sid Meyer's *Pirates* with music provided by comhaltas.ie.
